$> ant jar


Run
---

Most configuration requires CPLEX Solver (version 12.5 was used). 
Make sure that the system see the CPLEX binary libraries, e.g:

$> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/ibm/ilog/cplex/bin/x86-64_sles10_4.1

Run using configuration hc_lnshc.conf:

$> java -jar build/jar/roadef.jar -conf conf/hc_lnshc.conf -p data/A/model_a1_2.txt -i data/A/assignment_a1_2.txt -o new_assignment_a1_2.txt -t 300

This code was developed under very high time pressure by people of various 
levels of Java tolerance. Be lenient in evaluating the code.
